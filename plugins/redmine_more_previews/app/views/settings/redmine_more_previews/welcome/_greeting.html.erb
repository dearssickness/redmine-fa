Welcome to Redmine More Previews plugin configuration. Below find a list of the currently installed plugins of this plugin. That is plugins of a plugin, which work similar as Redmine's plugins. However, they get installed in the plugin's 'converter' directory. Each plugin should list extensions of files it can handle. In the dropdown box next to the extension choose the format of the file conversion to present in the browser. The plugin will give a warning notice if you activate identical file extension previewers from different plugins. Have fun!
